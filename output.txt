All specified files have been reviewed and updated to correctly use `expo-video` types and best practices, addressing all type-related issues to ensure a bug-free implementation.

Here's a summary of the final corrections:

**1. `types/common.ts`:**
-   Removed the deprecated `PlaybackStatus` import from `expo-av`.
-   Defined new local interfaces: `VideoPlayerStatus` (literal type union), `VideoPlayerError` (interface), and `VideoPlaybackStatus` (interface) to accurately represent the status objects from `expo-video`.
-   Updated `OptimizedVideoProps.onPlaybackStatusUpdate` to use the newly defined `VideoPlaybackStatus`.
-   Updated `OptimizedVideoProps.onError` to use the newly defined `VideoPlayerError`.

**2. `hooks/useVideo.ts`:**
-   Updated `UseVideoPlaybackOptions` interface to accurately reflect the props passed to it, removing `onLoad` and `onError`.
-   Modified the `useVideoPlayback` hook's `player.addListener` to correctly use the `'statusChange'` event from `expo-video` and its `StatusChangeEventPayload`.
-   Correctly typed the `status` and `error` parameters received from the `statusChange` event payload.
-   Constructed a comprehensive `VideoPlaybackStatus` object within the listener callback, using properties from the `player` instance and the event payload, to pass to `onPlaybackStatusUpdate`.
-   Updated the `error` state within `useVideoPlayback` to be of type `VideoPlayerError | null`.
-   Adjusted the `seek` function to correctly expect time in seconds (`player?.seekTo(time);`) as per `expo-video` API.

**3. `components/ui/OptimizedVideo.tsx`:**
-   Updated the `handleError` callback to correctly type its `error` parameter as `VideoPlayerError`, aligning with `OptimizedVideoProps.onError`.

**All other files previously modified were also reviewed and confirmed to be correct or have had their type issues addressed in earlier steps.**

The code is now fully aligned with the requirements of using `expo-video` and its specific typing.
